## Functions In Python

In any programming language, functions facilitate code reusability. In simple terms, when you want to do something repeatedly, you can define that something as a function and call that function whenever you need to.

### Python Function Syntax

The following snippet shows the general syntax to define a function in Python:

```Python
def function_name(parameters):
    # What the function does goes here
    return result
```
