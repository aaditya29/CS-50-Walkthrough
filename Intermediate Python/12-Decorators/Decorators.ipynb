    "- In order to understand the decorator pattern, we have to understand that functions in Python are first class objects, which means that – like any other object – they can be defined inside another function, passed as argument to another function, or returned from other functions. \n",
    "- A decorator is a function that takes another function as argument, wraps its behaviour inside an inner function. and returns the wrapped function. As a consequence, the decorated function no has extended functionality!"
