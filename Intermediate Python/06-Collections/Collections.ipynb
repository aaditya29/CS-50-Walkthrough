    "# Collections In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The collections module in Python implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some most useful tools of Containers:\n",
    "- `namedtuple` : factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields\n",
    "- `OrderedDict` : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added\n",
    "- `Counter` : dict subclass for counting hashable objects\n",
    "- `defaultdict` : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values\n",
    "- `deque` : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end"
